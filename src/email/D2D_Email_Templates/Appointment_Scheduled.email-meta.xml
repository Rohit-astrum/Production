    <subject>Your appointment with Direct Energy Solar</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName}, 

It was great talking to you today about Direct Energy Solar and how you might save money and take control of unpredictable electricity bills. Thanks for taking the time to learn about us and how you can become your own energy provider.

Your appointment with the Direct Energy Solar Consultant is scheduled for {!Event.ActivityDate}.

If you were not able to provide an electricity bill at the time of the visit, please use this e-mail address to send me a copy of your latest electric bill. Below are some options for sending a copy of your bill in:

• If you have on-line access to your account, you can save a copy of your bill on your computer, usually as an Adobe pdf. You can then e-mail this copy attached to the reply to me.

• If you don’t have on-line access, you can scan a paper copy of your bill and attach the scanned image or pdf to the reply to me.

• Should neither of these options work for you then you can fax a copy to (800) 949-1408. Please make sure you write my name on the first page of the fax, so I may identify it.


If you have any questions, you may contact us Monday to Friday 9 am to 5 pm EST at 1-844-473-4274 or sales.support@directenergysolar.com.

Congratulations on taking this first step toward becoming energy independent!

And thanks for your time and your interest in Direct Energy Solar!



Best,
