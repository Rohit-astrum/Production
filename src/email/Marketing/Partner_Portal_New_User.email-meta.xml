    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Welcome to the Direct Energy Solar Referral Partner Program!

We are excited to have you as a Partner. As a Direct Energy Solar Partner, you will open new sales opportunities for you and for your organization! The goal of the program is for you to present Direct Energy Solar as your company’s official solar partner. As a Referral Partner we want you to do what you do best – talk with your customers about solar. Once you generate a qualified lead, we’ll take it from there answering questions, providing information and helping convert your leads into Direct Energy Solar customers.

Below is your username and password to access our Partner Portal. This Portal will provide access to exclusive Direct Energy Solar marketing tools and resources to help you acquire leads.  More importantly the portal will allow you to submit qualified leads and track their progress through the sales cycle. The Portal can be accessed at partners.directenergysolar.com.

My contact information is below. Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions.

Regards,

Suzanne Borneman
