    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName},

Thank you for your recent inquiry regarding solar for your home. We just left you a phone message and are sorry we missed you. We will be calling you back in an attempt to reach you in person. 

Should you wish to speak to a solar specialist before we connect please give us a call back at 800-903-6130 and select the option for sales. One of our solar specialists will consult with you to answer questions you may have and to determine if your home is a good candidate for solar. We will also set up an agreeable time that is convenient for you to have a solar consultant meet with you in your home to review your options. 

Whether your decision to inquire about solar is because you want to save money on your electricity bill, or you want to have a bigger influence on our environment, Direct Energy Solar is an expert at installing residential solar and we will tailor a system to meet your specific needs. 

Again, I will attempt to reach you personally, but if you prefer, please call us at 800-903-6130 and select the option for sales so that  we can get you started. 

Thank you and have a great day.

Best,
