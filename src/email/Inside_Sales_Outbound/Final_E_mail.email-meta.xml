    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName},

We’ve been trying to reach you and we haven’t heard back from you. We’re wondering if you have any questions or concerns about switching to solar. 
At Astrum, we concentrate exclusively on home solar power. We can tell you about our free installation and customized system design services — it won’t take much time and may answer a lot of your questions. 

Don’t lose out on this chance to go solar for nothing out-of-pocket and start saving right away! This is the last time we’ll be reaching out to you, so if you’re still interested, please call us back at
800-903-6130 and select the option for Sales.

We can’t wait to hear from you!

Best,
