    <subject>The Direct Energy Solar Difference</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName},

It was great to talk with you today. I would like to take this opportunity to provide you with more information about Direct Energy Solar.

You only get to choose a solar installer once for your home, and it is important to choose an installer who will be there to educate you prior to your installation, make the installation process easy, and provide support after your installation.

What Makes Direct Energy Solar Different?

Going solar is a big and exciting decision that will change your home forever. Our consultative approach helps us learn everything we can about your goals and priorities so we can design a system that works for your home.

At Direct Energy Solar, we like to say we do solar “the right way.” And here’s why:

Custom-Designed System—Designed Specifically for Your Home
Payment Choices—You Decide What’s Best for You
Fast Installation—We Handle All the Paperwork
Guaranteed System Performance—Or We Pay You
A Lifetime of Support—We’ve Got You Covered

Our solar professionals invest the time and apply their skill at the very beginning to design and install a solar system that is tailored to each customer’s specific needs and the realities of each roof. Many installers use “cookie cutter” generic system designs that are all the same size and configuration. While this approach makes it easier for our competitors to install, this does not maximize your solar financial benefit and often lowers your maximum production. Our custom designs maximize your rate of return.

We want our customers to enjoy the entire experience of going solar and not just the end results. So, we work hard to make sure the experience is turnkey, effortless and worry-free. Our professionals take care of everything, from precise measurements of your roof to post-installation paperwork for grants and rebates, and everything in between.

Attached to this e-mail you&apos;ll find a detailed overview of what our company has to offer.

Best,
{!User.FirstName}
