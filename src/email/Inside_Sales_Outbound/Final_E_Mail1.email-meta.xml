    <subject>May we still help you go solar?</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName},

We have been attempting to reach you to follow up on your inquiry to go solar for your home. Since we have not heard back from you, we wanted to reach out to see if you were still interested or had any questions.

We would like the opportunity to speak with you directly to answer your questions and to set up convenient time for a Direct Energy Solar Sales Consultant to meet with you. On our initial phone call, we will work with you to determine if your home is a good candidate to take advantage of solar power and walk you through our easy, turnkey process of going solar. It is easier—and more affordable—than you may think. We will tell you about our free installation and tailored system designs—it won’t take much time.

Because we have made several attempts to contact you and have been unsuccessful thus far, we do not want to bother you in the event you have changed your mind at this time. Therefore, this will be the last time we will be reaching out to you. If we have just been unlucky in reaching you and you still would like to meet with a Solar Consultant to better understand the amazing savings that are possible and/or the positive impact you could have on our environment, please give us a call at 800-903-6130.

Direct Energy Solar is the best in this business and will ensure your experience in going solar is simple, turnkey and enjoyable. We look forward to meeting you and servicing your residential solar needs.

Best,

{!User.FirstName}
