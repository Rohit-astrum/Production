Your Sun. Your Power. Your Way.

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

Installing a solar system on your home is a smart way to immediately save on your monthly power bill. And now there is an innovative new way to pay for your system and maximize your energy savings.

Direct Energy Solar’s mission is to make going solar as easy and rewarding as possible for you. That’s why we’re so excited to let you know about a new, no-fee, no-money-down financing plan we’ve just introduced through our partner, Sungage Financial.

As one of the nation’s leading solar finance companies, Sungage is committed to providing homeowners like you with consumer-friendly financing options that allow you to own your solar equipment—for less money and in less time than with other plans. In fact, you don’t need any money down to start saving on your energy bill.

Eliminate Any Out-of-Pocket Investment

As you are likely aware, the federal government currently offers a 30% Tax Credit &lt;http://energy.gov/savings/residential-renewable-energy-tax-credit&gt; on the cost of installing your system, which is set to expire at the end of 2016. Sungage®† has developed an innovative approach that allows you to take advantage of those tax credits from day one with a 0% loan(1) and no additional fees.

A Quicker Path to Saving Money

Another advantage of Sungage’s financing options are shorter terms than those of our existing loans. Sungage offers 10-year loans to allow you to pay off your system faster and start saving sooner.

And with extremely competitive rates, financing with Sungage is very easy.(1) Rates are currently at an APR of 5.49% for 10 years.
Once your loan is repaid, you’ll enjoy “free” electricity from the sun! That’s smart planning for the future.

Get Paid for Your Clean Energy Production

You’re probably also aware of another benefit of going solar with us: we can help you sell Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs). Those are the credits you earn for all the clean energy your system produces each year, which pays you back in cash when sold on the open market.

Now, rather than waiting to accumulate and then sell your SRECs at end of each year, you can start putting these dollars to work for you immediately when you finance through Sungage(2).

Let’s Talk!

Now you can see why I’m so excited to show you how a Sungage loan can be applied to your home’s solar project. So what’s stopping you? Contact me today to set up your appointment.
