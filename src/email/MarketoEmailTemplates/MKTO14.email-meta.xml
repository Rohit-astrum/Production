Deadline extended to take advantage of best possible pricing!

Group pricing will be honored through July 31.

Solarize Needham&apos;s roup pricing has been extended!

The overwhelming support and enthusiasm for Solarize Needham has made the program an unqualified success, so Astrum Solar is continuing to honor the group pricing through July 31. In addition, Astrum Solar will be making customers whole on the state rebate.* Move quickly to get your contract signed. Thanks to the hard work of local volunteers, Solarize Needham reached Tier 5 pricing, the lowest available! This means that, in addition to state and local incentives, everyone who signs up is able to take advantage of the lowest pricing possible through the program. Now is the best time to go solar.

Don’t miss the new deadline! Contact your solar consultant today to discuss your system and how you can go solar and start producing your own electricity for less than what you are currently paying your utility company.
