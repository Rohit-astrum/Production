Special Series: Solar Payback Factors

Solar Payback Factor #3: Your Electricity Rates and Consumption

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

Solar has many variables that can influence how much of a return you see from your system. In this special series focusing on solar payback factors, we’ll be taking a look at electricity consumption and rates &lt;[[http://pages.directenergysolar.com/rs/astrumsolarinc/images/DirectEnergySolar_UnderstandingSolarPower.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=pbfactors3&amp;utm_campaign=nurture-tk&amp;utm_content=pbfactors3-link-consumptionrates]]&gt;.

This is one of the biggest variables in the solar payback equation. No two households are completely alike in terms of how much energy they use, when they use it, what rate plan they are on, and what other devices/systems they are using to manage their power consumption.

How much electricity you consume and what rate you pay will influence your payback from solar.

In some utility jurisdictions, like California, some homeowners are on tiered rate plans, where they consume a certain amount of base load at one price, then consume higher amounts of electricity at higher price tiers.

Electricity rates are predicted to soar because of the potential need for power companies to spend more to provide uninterrupted power generation. For ratepayers, like you, that predicts rising electricity costs in the coming years.(1)

A great way to shield yourself from unexpected rate hikes is to switch to solar. To determine how much you could save and what return you’ll see, we’ll collect data about your consumption and utility rates to determine what your system will generate.

“We were starting to think about retirement. We have a fairly large house, and we needed to figure out how to get some stability to our utility costs.” - Martha and Thomas
