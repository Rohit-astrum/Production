Let&apos;s lower your electricity bill.

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

We’ve been trying to reach you and haven’t heard back. May we still help you go solar?

We have been trying to reach you to help you instantly lower your utility costs and protect you from rising electricity rates. Since we have not heard back from you, we wanted to reach out to see if you were still interested in going solar or if you had any questions.

We understand you are busy and want to be respectful of your time and email inbox, so we’ll stop reaching out for the time being—we don’t want to be a pest! We hope to have the opportunity to help you go solar.

If you are still interested, please call us at 800-903-6130.
