Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

Adoption of solar power is skyrocketing! Did you know the demand for solar is going to increase to over 1.5 million homes in 2017?

Your business already provides a valuable service for home owners. As a Referral Partner of Direct Energy Solar, you can help your customers save money on one of their highest monthly expenses by sharing your solar opportunity with them. When one of your customers decides to go solar, they will have decades of potential electricity savings that YOU helped them discover. What a great way to ensure they will continue to do business with you for the long term and refer you to their friends and family. Both our companies will benefit from our relationship.

Remember that you don’t have to sell solar – just provide referrals! It takes only minutes of conversation with a customer to get them excited about going solar.

Let me help you reach your solar goals:
• We will do all the marketing and selling
• Risk-free for your business
• Simple online portal to input leads and track your revenue

Become a Referral Partner &lt;http://partners.directenergysolar.com/roof&gt; for Direct Energy Solar today!
