California Is a Solar Leader

California continues to be a leading solar market in the United States because of an abundance of sunny days. With all of the sunshine that California receives, going solar is absolutely the smart thing to do.

Take advantage of that abundance of sunshine to power your home. Thousands of your California neighbors have already made the switch, taking control of their utility costs rather than paying their utility company. You can too.

Don’t miss this special offer.

Otherwise, $500 cash back rebate to be mailed approximately 30 days after the system is installed. Minimum system size is 5 kW.

Only one discount offer per household.

Offers and financing are not available in all areas.
