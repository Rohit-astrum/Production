Your Sun. Your Power. Your Way.
Thousands of Customers Have Switched to Solar!

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

 Thank you for your interest in saving money for your business with solar energy. 

One of our solar experts will contact you within the next few days to follow up on your request for a no obligation commercial solar site assessment. If you want to prepare in advance, please gather your past 12 months of electricity bills (in kilowatt-hours) from your utility provider. This will help us to clearly understand the size of the system and energy savings available for your facility.

There has never been a better time to go solar, particularly with the pending expiration of a 30% Federal Tax Credit in 2016. Direct Energy Solar offers multiple financing options including opportunities to realize immediate savings with no money down. 

We look forward to working with you to help you understand your solar savings opportunities. 




Your Sun. Your Power. Your Way.

You’re receiving this email because you’ve expressed interest in a Direct Energy Solar system installation.

Offers and financing are available to customers who qualify, vary by location, and are not available in all areas. We customize our solar power system specifically for your facility, therefore, pricing, savings, utility bill, solar bill amounts and actual returns vary based on different factors including but not limited to your location, system size, available solar incentives and local utility rates. See terms and conditions for more details.
