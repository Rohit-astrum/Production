Dear Homeowner,

We’re delighted to introduce you to Direct Energy Solar.

Direct Energy’s vision is to harness our energy expertise to make a difference in people’s lives—our newest division, Direct Energy Solar, has been providing money-saving solar solutions for thousands of customers across the country since 2008. A great way to take control of your energy costs is to use the power of the sun. Solar energy has the potential to save you thousands on your energy bills for decades.

Why are so many Americans switching solar energy?

We’ve all been there. Month after month, we open the utility bill...only to be shocked at its unpredictability. In contrast, solar will provide a consistent, reliable source of power on your roof—your monthly electricity bills will be less than what you’re currently paying your utility provider and you’ll be insulated from electricity price increases.

Solar is more accessible and affordable than ever. And it’s positive impact on daily life is profound. When your home is solar powered, you can worry less about the small stuff, like recharging your family’s gadgets or turning up the thermostat a few degrees on a chilly night. And you can feel great about the big stuff, like your lighter carbon footprint and the example you are setting for your friends, neighbors and family.
