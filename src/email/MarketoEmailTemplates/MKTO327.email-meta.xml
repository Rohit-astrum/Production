Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},
Direct Energy Solar would like to have you on board as a partner. You are probably aware of research indicating homeowner&apos;s value contracotrs who take the time to expose them to new, money saviing products.  Differentiate yourself in the marketplace and increase your value to your customers --and your profits -just by letting them know about the benefits of going solar.
You don’t have to be a solar expert to make this program a success, but it helps to understand the basics. I will help you understand the nuts and bolts about how solar works and what the value of solar is to the homeowner. 
It’s easy and risk-free to sign up to become a partner.
• We will do all the marketing and selling
• You get an easy-to-use online portal to input your leads and to track payouts

I look forward to speaking to you more about this great opportunity for both our businesses.
