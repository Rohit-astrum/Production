A special message for our valued customers.




Wishing You All Things Sunny &amp; Bright This Holiday Season!

{{lead.First Name:default=Friend}}, you helped us light up this year with solar! Over the next 20 years, the systems we installed this year alone will:

Generate an estimated $100,000,000 in electricity savings
(payments not made to utility)

Generate an estimated $40,000,000 in net savings for our customers
(money saved over and above what was invested)

Avoid emission of 500,000,000 pounds of CO2

Warmest wishes for a Happy Holiday and a Bright New Year! Let 2016 be a year full of sunshine, electricity savings and good health.

From,
Your friends at Direct Energy Solar
