30 Second Solar Overview: Plug into the Sun!

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

Solar power is on the rise. Did you know that last year, a new solar system was installed on someone’s home or business every two minutes(1) in the U.S.?

We congratulate you on taking the next step towards energy independence and want to help educate our neighbors investigating solar. Check out our simple graphic &lt;[[http://www.directenergysolar.com/blog/post/30-second-solar-overview-plug-into-the-sun?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=30overview&amp;utm_campaign=nurtur&amp;utm_content=30overview-link-checkout]]&gt;—we’ve condensed what can be a complex process into a simple step-by-step overview of going solar, from your main reason to switch to solar, to choosing an installer, and the day you start seeing the sunny savings.

In just 30 seconds, you’ll learn:
• The benefits of switching to solar power
• The disadvantages of waiting any longer to go solar
• The options you’ll choose from to customize your system
• The process to make solar happen for you

Check Out the :30 Solar Overview:

“We tell people that if they’re going to make the decision to go solar, they should do it now. Now’s the time to do it, and to start reaping the savings.” - David and Mary
