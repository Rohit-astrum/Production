What’s a Solar Production Guarantee?

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

Why is a solar production guarantee so important? In short, it provides peace of mind that your solar system will generate the amount of energy that you were promised.

Many solar installers overpromise what your installation will generate by showing you exaggerated energy output.

Let’s discover how a proper roof evaluation and a solar production guarantee protect you and your investment.

Learn Why You Should Insist on a Production Guarantee:

“Direct Energy Solar’s evaluation of our roof was more thorough and logical than anyone else’s, but their flexibility when it came to meeting our specific needs was the tipping point for us.” - Rochelle
