The Early Birds in Your County Get… Extra Savings!
The first 10 people to go solar receive $1,000 discount(1). 

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

If you’ve been considering solar, now is the perfect time to begin your electricity-saving investment and lock in lower rates for decades to come...and we’re adding in some extra savings to get you started.

You see your neighbors going solar. So what’s stopping you? Right now, you have yet another reason to join them:

Be one of the first 10 people go solar in your county beginning October 6. You’ll receive $1,000 discount(1) on your system.

This discount is in addition to the numerous financial and environmental benefits that you and your family will enjoy when you go solar. But you must act quickly, as this offer is of limited availability. Join your neighbors and lead the way of the future by shining as a bright example of energy efficiency, conservation and independence in your community.

Another reason to take action now:

Did you know that the Federal government provides a 30% tax credit &lt;http://energy.gov/savings/residential-renewable-energy-tax-credit&gt; that is set to expire at the end of next year? This generous incentive has been helping to make solar more affordable than ever—and you can take advantage of it when you purchase your system with cash or loan.

Act now and you could save thousands upfront on the cost of your solar system and beat the anticipated rush as the Federal Tax Credit deadline approaches.

Don’t wait any longer. Contact us today.

We’re ready to design and install a customized solar panel system for your home that will give you the most for your investment, the most energy generated, and the most satisfaction each time you see a sunny day. What are you waiting for?

Get started today by calling us at 800-903-6130 to schedule your consultation.

Your Sun. Your Power. Your Way.
