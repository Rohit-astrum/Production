Solar Product Warranties vs. Workmanship Warranties

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

As you start to research if solar is right for you, you’ll likely come across two terms that sound similar but actually provide two different forms of protection for your solar system:

• Solar Product Warranties
• Solar Workmanship Warranties

Going solar is an exciting decision that will change your home forever. Your system will be up on your roof for decades providing power for your home, so it’s important to understand how these two warranties provide you with peace of mind on your investment.

But what do these 2 terms mean exactly? And how do they differ?
