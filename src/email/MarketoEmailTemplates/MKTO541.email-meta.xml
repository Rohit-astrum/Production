A Special Message for Our Valued Customers

Friends don’t let friends miss out...on SRECs!

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

As a valued Direct Energy Solar customer, you are already well aware of the benefits of Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs). Not only are you saving money with solar, but you are offsetting your cost of going solar as well!

Remaining capacity in the SREC II program is filling up fast—how does this affect you?

On January 5, the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources (DOER) announced that 120 MW would be set aside in the SREC II program for solar projects under 25 kW. On February 18, DOER provided a program status update—only 67 MW of the initial 120 MW remained. A mad rush to go solar in Massachusetts is under way—at this pace, it’s highly possible that the remaining 67 MW could be gone as early as April!

At this time, there are no plans to increase or adjust the program cap. While this current situation has no impact on your SRECs, it does affect people you know who may be considering going solar and may therefore miss out on a great incentive. But, you can help!

February 29 is an important date for 2 reasons.

As you know, we are currently running a very generous referral promotion and have extended it until February 29. When you refer your friends, family, neighbors—anyone you think would be a great candidate for solar—to us, and they sign their contract by February 29, you receive $750.(1)

Based on the most current program status information available, we are confident that your referral will be successfully registered for participation in the SREC II program if they sign their contract with Direct Energy Solar on or before February 29.(2) Why so soon? For a project to be successfully registered for SREC II participation, we need to secure the necessary approvals and municipal permits.

So, this means your referral will get to enjoy the benefits of SRECs, and you earn some extra cash!

HURRY! Refer your friends today:

Your Sun. Your Power. Your Way.
