Special Series: Solar Payback Factors

Solar Payback Factor #1: The Size of Your Solar Installation

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

Solar has many variables that can influence how much of a return you see from your system. In this special series focusing on solar payback factors, we’ll be taking a look at installation size &lt;[[http://pages.directenergysolar.com/rs/astrumsolarinc/images/DirectEnergySolar_UnderstandingSolarPower.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=pbfactors2&amp;utm_campaign=nurture-tk&amp;utm_content=pbfactors2-link-installsize]]&gt;.

On average, solar panels can generate approximately 250 watts per panel. The maximum amount your total system can produce is equal to the number of panels multiplied by 250 watts. Many of our systems are in the 8 kW range—a system comprised of 32 panels.

Every Installation is Customized. What’s Right for You?

Your roof may or may not have enough space for an installation of 8 kW. In some cases, customers will use a ground mount system, or install panels on adjacent structures as alternatives to a roof-mounted system.

A system can be sized to offset a specific amount of your total load in watts, including systems that completely offset all of your production, depending on where you live.

“Direct Energy Solar had the best reputation and gave us the best payback. They were upfront about everything, honest about the details, and were pretty flexible in working with us on the design and how the panels were fitted on the roof.” - Sharon and Elliot
