A Message from Our Partner Program

You are invited to join Astrum Solar&apos;s Partner Program.

Solar energy is the future. You can be a part of it.

The Astrum Solar Partners Program is a great way to add to your bottom line by participating in one of the hottest growth segments for home owners. Solar installations are skyrocketing with more solar installations in the US over the last 18 months than in the past 30 years. With no investment on your part, you can profit from that growth!

All you have to do is something you are already doing, talk to your customers and refer them to us. For every home owner you refer to us that completes a site survey, you get paid, and your cash bonus is even higher if they become one of our customers.

Discover a new opportunity. Profit from solar’s growth.
