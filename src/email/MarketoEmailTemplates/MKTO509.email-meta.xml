LET’S GET YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED!

Do Solar Panels Require Maintenance?
 &lt;[[http://www.directenergysolar.com/the-basics/frequently-asked-questions?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=febnews&amp;utm_campaign=nurtur&amp;utm_content=febnews-img-questions]]&gt;

With the harsh winter-related weather the country has been experiencing recently, you may be wondering how this would affect your solar panels.

Solar panels are basically maintenance-free. They have no moving parts that may wear over time and do not require any cleaning. Seasonal rainfall is typically sufficient to keep your solar panels clean. You may need to occasionally remove larger debris, depending on the slope of your roof. And don’t worry about snow on your solar panels—they do an excellent job of absorbing heat, which helps melt the snow.

Solar panels are incredibly resilient and durable. At Direct Energy Solar, we use high quality PV panels developed by industry-leading manufacturers who rigorously test their products. In addition, we offer both workmanship warrantees and performance guarantees. Should any part of your system fail, Direct Energy Solar will replace it at no charge to you. We’ve got you covered.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY TIP OF THE MONTH

Lower the average temperature of your HVAC and water systems. It’s easy to do, and a few degrees isn’t a noticeable change—try it out yourself!

The more energy efficient you become, the less electricity you use. Reduced power consumption means you’ll need fewer solar panels to cover all of your electricity requirements! So, energy efficiency not only offers instant utility bill savings but also indirect savings if you decide to go solar.
