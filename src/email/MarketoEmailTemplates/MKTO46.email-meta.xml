A Message from Our Partner Program

Boost your company&apos;s success.

Solar energy is the future. Are you missing out?

Discover a new opportunity.

Massachusetts is a solar leader. 

Solar momentum is strong, and you can profit from it.

The Astrum Solar Partners Program is a great way to add to your bottom  line by participating in one of the hottest growth segments for home  owners. Massachusetts has one of the best incentive climates for solar  energy. In 2013, the Commonwealth Solar Rebate Program surpassed  Governor Patrick’s initial goal of 250 MW of solar power installed—four  years early! There is now a new goal of 1,600 MW of solar capacity  installed by 2020. With no investment on your part, why not profit from  that growth?

All you have to do is something you are already doing, talk to your  customers in Massachusetts and refer them to us. For every home owner you  refer to us that completes a site survey, you get paid, and your cash  bonus is even higher if they become one of our customers.
