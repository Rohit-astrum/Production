A special message for our valued customers.

POWER FOR YOUR HOME WHEN THE POWER GOES OUT

Solar Power + Storage Capability = Security and Grid Stability through Battery Storage

With financial support from the Maryland Energy Administration, Astrum Solar is launching a groundbreaking project to bring affordable, smart battery storage to a select group of Maryland homeowners. Through innovative software development our systems utilize proven, tested technology to create ground breaking opportunities for YOU!!

Solar energy gave homeowners the first chance at real control over their power sources. The next stage in smart grid development is utilizing battery storage to harness the full potential of your solar system to interact with the grid and provide monthly revenue and security to your home.

Security
When the grid goes down your solar panels will operate to charge the batteries, allowing a predetermined set of critical loads in your home (heat, refrigerator, lighting, security system, sump or well pump) to continue functioning until grid power is restored.

Grid Stability
In addition, the batteries will be monitored and used to help maintain the stability of the grid through frequency regulation. This “frequency market participation” will even generate a small amount of revenue for the customer each year.

Be one of the first 20 customers in all of Maryland to enjoy this ground breaking system

This offer is truly at the forefront of Smart Grid technology. No other solar installer can provide such an innovative offering to help homeowners fully harness their solar system’s power while also protecting their assets in the event of a grid outage and generating revenue from grid participation.
