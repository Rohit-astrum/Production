Dear Friend,

Please join us Monday November 16th for an Open House and Fire Safety Training at Direct Energy Solar’s Hudson Valley headquarters in Middletown, NY. 

Since 2010, Direct Energy Solar has served hundreds of families throughout the Hudson Valley—many of whom are in our own backyard! Now we invite you to our home in Middletown to learn more about solar and how Direct Energy Solar is helping your community go green and save money. 

Monday, November 16
7:00 – 7:30pm: Fire Safety Training
7:30 – 9:00pm: Open House and Solar Info Session
28 Industrial Dr., Middletown NY 10941
RSVP

During the first part of the evening, our Operations Team will host a Fire Safety Training for regional fire safety officials. Following this half hour presentation you’ll have a chance to speak one-on-one with our Solar Consultants, Operations Team, and current customers. You can also learn about special limited-time solar discounts currently available in the Hudson Valley. 

While our doors are always open, there’s no better opportunity than this event to get your questions answered and find out if switching to solar is right for you. 

We look forward to seeing you November 16th!
