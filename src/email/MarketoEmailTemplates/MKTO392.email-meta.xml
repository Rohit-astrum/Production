Dear Homeowner,

Do you open your electricity bill each month and cringe? Your warranty from Home Warranty of America is providing you peace of mind from the unexpected surprises of owning your new home, but how to do protect yourself from that shock when you open your electricity bill? Direct Energy Solar, part of our family of brands, has the answer.

What if we told you solar energy can help you save?

In fact, solar energy has the potential to save you thousands on your energy bills for decades. That’s money you could be pouring into your new home in other ways, like home improvements, new furniture or upgraded appliances. It’s your money. Spend it the way you want, not the way your utility company wants.

Direct Energy Solar has already helped thousands of customers harness rays of sunshine to provide a consistent, reliable source of power—and they are in your neighborhood and ready to do the same for you.

What are the benefits of switching to solar power?

Financial Savings

Energy Independence

Home Value Increases

Your Own “Green” Power Plant

Three reasons why now is the perfect time for solar.

1.) Solar is more accessible and affordable than ever. 
 The cost of solar panels has decreased 80% between 2009 and 2013 and they will continue to drop, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency &lt;http://www.irena.org&gt;.

2.) Electricity costs are predicted to rise in the coming years.(1)
 That’s because power companies will potentially need to spend more to guarantee their customers uninterrupted power generation.

3.) The Federal government provides a 30% tax credit that will expire at the end of 2016. 
 You could save thousands on the cost of your solar system, but you must act now to beat the anticipated rush as the deadline approaches &lt;http://energy.gov/savings/residential-renewable-energy-tax-credit&gt;.
