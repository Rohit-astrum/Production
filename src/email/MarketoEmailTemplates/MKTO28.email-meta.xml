Strategic Partners Program Newsletter




Welcome!

We are looking forward to introducing you to the new Astrum Solar partners newsletter which will give strategic partners and their staff the opportunity to stay up to date on the program, learn more about Astrum Solar and a chance to keep pace with the momentum of our fast-paced industry.

The purpose of this newsletter is to educate partners in the areas of sales, lead generation, business best practices and how to both stay connected and better prepare them for making connections to a new generation of consumers.

In the first issue of the newsletter, which will be distributed every month, we will tell you about partner successes through the third quarter, offer business tips and over time begin to update and inform you of changes at Astrum, with the solar industry and provide an exchange of ideas and experiences partners have had with Astrum Solar.

Program Highlight: 90 Days

Through the third quarter of 2014 the goal was to partner with 100 new businesses and organizations. As of this publication 94 new partners have joined the program and with three months to go we should easily go way beyond the century mark.

In looking at the past 90 days we had a chance to evaluate our top lead generators and focus on some best-practices that can lead to achieving ambitious sales bonuses.

1. Talk to your customers about solar.

2. Create an “elevator pitch” about saving money on electricity.

3. Get to know the local Astrum sales rep.

4. Leverage the trust you have established, sell Astrum to them.

Tip of the Month

Make the 80–20 Rule work at work!

The 80-20 rule, or ‘Pareto Principle’, is based on the idea that a relatively small percentage of any cause (20%) creates most of the subsequent effects (80%).

This applies to everything you do at work.

Whatever task, project, role or goal you have, tackle it with the 80–20 rule in mind.

Try this five step sequence:

1. Start with the end. What is the outcome you want?

2. When you’re clear about that, break it down into the actions you need to take to get there.

3. Do the actions in the most accurate order you can. Learn how to prioritize work.

4. Keep asking “What’s the next relevant action step to take?”

5. Repeat until complete.

Ready for punchline?

You’ve just successfully applied the 80–20 rule!

How are you applying this to your solar referrals?

Best Practices

Marketing + Strategy + Speed = Business Growth

As each of you know, running a successful business is not easy. And trying to build one that is profitable each and every year is even harder. If you want to take your company to the next level, you must stay on top of all of the new developments in marketing (i.e. traditional &amp; digital), have a strategy to promote your uniqueness and respond quickly to customers. Here are three best practices to get you off and running...

3 Best Practices to Think About:

1. Marketing

Primary role is to attract and serve customers, put your creativity to work and find ways to be different.
• add a new product line
• create a new service offering
• send a handwritten note

2. Strategy

This is about focus and being okay with saying no, be courageous and happy to be good at something unique.
• focus on what you are good at
• don’t try to be all things to all people
• sell your value proposition, don’t compete solely on price

3. Speed

Customers perceive value in speed.
• be first to the appointment
• respond within 1-day to all customers
• thank all customers the day the job is complete
