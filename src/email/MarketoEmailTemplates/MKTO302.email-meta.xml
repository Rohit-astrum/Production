Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

Did you know the cost of solar panels has dropped 80% since 2008? Meanwhile, panels have become more efficient, offering greater-than-ever energy savings. What does this have to do with your business? We want your help to get the word out to your customers.

You’ll get in on profit potential of solar technology simply by partnering with Direct Energy Solar—one of the nation’s leading solar companies—and by referring interested customers to us. We do all the rest, and you get a nice check—up to $900 per referral* if they go solar with us. It’s that easy. And it’s a great way for your business to generate income during the upcoming off-season.

As you know adding a pool increases a homeowner’s cost of electricity by 30-50%. But now you can help your customers erase these escalating energy costs just by letting them know about the benefits of going solar.

Their energy savings are immediate, often with no money down. It’s as simple as that. What a great way to ensure they will continue to do business with you and refer your business to friends and family.


It&apos;s easy and risk-free to sign up to become a partner.

• You get an easy-to-use online portal to input referrals and track payouts

• We will do all the marketing and selling
