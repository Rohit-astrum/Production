Sunny Shout-Outs Direct from Our Customers

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

Our customers love us, but we can’t claim all of the credit—let’s face it, the sun does most of the work to power their homes!

In a buyer’s market with countless installers competing for your business, thousands of Direct Energy Solar customers have selected and trusted us with their solar installations...turning their sunny roofs into electricity savings.

But now we’ll let Uday and Arati do the talking.

It was an article in Smart Money magazine that made Uday decide that now is the time to go solar. He had long been curious about solar panels, but when he read an article in Smart Money about the financial benefits of going solar, he made his move.

Uday did extensive research on solar installers, and winnowed his search down to two companies: Direct Energy Solar and another, large solar installer.

“Direct Energy Solar had everything I wanted—the right panels, cutting edge technology and personalized service.”
