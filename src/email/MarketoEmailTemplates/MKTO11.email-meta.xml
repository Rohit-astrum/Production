Join Your Neighbors at a Solar Open House!

Discounted program pricing expires August 31. Don’t miss out!

The MORE POWER TO CHOOSE volunteer team is working hard to spread the word about solar! With the August 31 special pricing deadline quickly approaching, we invite you to join us at the last scheduled open house! You will be able to talk to installers and locals who have solar on their roofs and learn more about Wellesley’s surprisingly high rate of return on investment for this sustainability-oriented program. Take advantage of special deals available only during Wellesley’s MORE POWER TO CHOOSE program.

Last Solar Open House
August 20  |  5:00 PM – 8:00 PM
12 Granite Street  |  Wellesley, MA

August 31 is rapidly approaching. Have you given solar a final thought?

Wellesley’s Municipal Light Plant is offering a generous rebate through the MORE POWER TO CHOOSE program. The discounted price (around 30% below the state average) expires August 31. Signing a contract before this date would enable you to have your panels installed before the WMLP solar rebate expires on December 31 and in time to get 2014 tax credits. But hurry! After August 31, you will not be able to take advatange of these exclusive savings provided by the WMLP rebate.

Don’t miss the deadline! Contact your solar consultant today to discuss your system and how you can go solar with MORE POWER TO CHOOSE and start producing your own electricity for less than what you are currently paying your utility company.

How Does the Solar Process Work?

At Astrum Solar, we provide a turnkey, worry-free experience for our customers. When you request your Free Home Solar Assessment, a member of Astrum Solar’s Inside Sales Team will be able to view satellite images of your home to get a basic understanding of the layout and roof space. Next, an Astrum Solar System Design Specialist will come to your home and measure your roof in order to provide an accurate solar production estimate. You will know exactly what your system will produce when you receive your proposal from your Astrum Solar Sales Consultant during your Sales visit. Once your contract is signed, an Astrum Solar Project Lead will be assigned to your solar installation and will be there to handle the entire installation process for you—and you will be on your way to electricity savings!

To get started or to re-engage yourself in the solar process, call Astrum Solar at 800-903-6130 or visit http://www.wellesleypowertochoose.com &lt;http://www.wellesleypowertochoose.com&gt; today.
