A Special Message for our Valued Customers

IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

We hope you are enjoying the benefits of your new solar system. Be sure to take advantage of New York state incentives to maximize the return on your investment.

New York residents may claim a state personal income tax credit equal to 25% of the full cost of installing a solar system, up to $5,000. The New York personal income tax credit is also available to customers who are leasing their systems from a third party owner. Lease customers may claim a tax credit up to the total amount of payments they make during the taxable year for up to 15 years.

To claim the New York personal income tax credit, you must submit Form IT-255 with your state tax return which can be found here &lt;[[https://www.tax.ny.gov/pdf/current_forms/it/it255_fill_in.pdf]]&gt;.

If you have additional questions about your personal tax situation, we recommend that you contact a tax professional. If you have any other inquiries about your system, please do not hesitate to contact the Customer Relationship Team directly, at 1-888-603-6085 or customeradvisors@directenergysolar.com &lt;[[mailto:customeradvisors@directenergysolar.com]]&gt;.

Thank you once more for choosing to go solar with Direct Energy Solar.

Best Regards,
