Strategic Partners Program Newsletter

WELCOME!

Thanksgiving offers important reminders for us in our professional and personal lives. As we all gather around the tables later this month and enjoy the company of family and good friends, let’s remember the following tips that help us have both a Happy Thanksgiving and happy business. 

PLANNING: Just like the Thanksgiving meal, your business takes a good amount of planning. Like a grocery list for the big meal — make sure you take time to get the ingredients that align your company &amp; staff to your long-term strategy. 

COLLABORATING: Utilize the talents of those around you. Similar to hosting a Thanksgiving dinner, it’s hard to do it alone. That’s why collaborating with others and delegating tasks is the key to success. 

COMMUNICATING: The last thing you want to happen at Thanksgiving is for three different people to bring the same dish because they didn’t get the potluck dinner memo. Making sure everyone in your business is on the same page with new developments and changes will help avoid miscommunications and upset employees and customers. 

THANKING: As Thanksgiving approaches, let’s remember to stop and give thanks to not only our family and friends but to our customers, clients, vendors and partners. Where would we be without them? On behalf of Astrum Solar, I would like to thank you for your partnership and support. My sincere wishes for a safe and Happy Thanksgiving.

Tip of the Month

Five tips for growing your business in 30 days or less

“There are few if any jobs in which ability alone is sufficient. Needed also, are loyalty, sincerity, enthusiasm and team play.” — William Given

Try these: 

1. Spend three hours a day calling potential customers — 80% of businesses suffer from the owners / sales reps not spending enough time connecting  with people who can write checks. 

2. Do low cost Adwords experiments — you don’t need thousands of dollars, you can run decent tests with a small portion of your marketing budget. 

3. Work on only new business until 11am — too often entrepreneurs get caught up in all this non-sales related activity then suddenly realize the day is over. Make a rule to go after new business until 11am every day. 

4. Introduce a closed door — hard to do? Imagine if you focused on sales, new relationships or company strategy for 2-3 (90-minute blocks) every day, without interruptions! 

5. See yourself as a top-level entrepreneur — you are only as successful as your identity allows.

Best Practices

What does teamwork mean to you and your business?

The difference between success and failure is a great team. No matter how smart, talented, driven or passionate you are, your success as a leader depends on your ability to build and inspire a team. A successful leader is one who can inspire his or her team members to work together toward a common vision and goals.

To inspire your team members you will have to talk to them of course. Everyone hates meetings, but how about a short huddle to get them aligned, motivated and inspired? One very effective way is to begin or end a huddle by sharing an inspirational quote. Here are some great quotes from well-known coaches, athletes, business leaders and authors that will inspire your team to work better together.

“Unity is strength...when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved.” — Mattie Stepanek

“The strength of the team is each individual member.” — Phil Jackson  

“Coming together is a beginning, keeping together is progress, working together is success.” — Henry Ford  

“None of us is as smart as all of us.” — Ken Blanchard  

“Individual commitment to group effort — that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work.” — Vince Lombardi 

You can do better with your team than you or I could do it alone. Astrum Solar is better because of our partnership with you — here’s to you, your team and our collective success!
