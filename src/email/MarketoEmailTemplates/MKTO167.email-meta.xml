Your Sun. Your Power. Your Way.

If you&apos;ve been looking into solar, you can&apos;t afford to miss our best offer ever!

{{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

I wanted to get this quick note off to you to let you know about a promotion that Direct Energy Solar is offering customers like you who are considering going solar with us.

I’m pretty excited because it is, by far, the best package of deals I’ve ever seen since I’ve been with Direct Energy Solar.

But these deals will only be available in your area until June 15, so you must act today to assure we can lock you into our best pricing ever. Here’s the details of the promotion:

Here’s the deal:

Get $1,500(1) When You Choose to Go Solar With Us!

At Direct Energy Solar, we like to help homeowners save. That’s why we would like to offer you a $1,500 cash back rebate when you sign your contract with us by June 15, 2015. It’s more money to put back into your pocket for better use than electricity bills, and it’s our best cash-back offer yet!

We Guarantee Your Installation or You Get $500!(2)

We want to get you on the road to electricity savings as quickly as possible. If you sign with us by June 15, 2015 and we do not install your solar system within 75 days, you will receive a $500 rebate or deduction from the final invoice.

Just for Meeting with Us, You’ll Get a Free(3) 6-month Heating &amp; Cooling Repair Essentials Plan from Direct Energy!

There’s no obligation to buy when you agree to meet with us to review your potential energy savings. In fact, we’re offering you an instant bonus just for letting us show you how much solar may save you on your monthly energy bill.

Meet with a Direct Energy Solar consultant for an in-home consultation by June 15, 2015 and receive a free 6-month Heating &amp; Cooling Repair Essentials Plan from Direct Energy Protection Plans. This plan provides worry-free coverage for inconvenient repairs.
