THERE’S NEVER BEEN A BETTER TIME TO GO SOLAR

Maplewood and South Orange homeowners now have a unique opportunity to go solar. Solarize SOMA, an organizing effort by volunteer neighbors, has launched a campaign to double the solar power generated in our towns. After an extensive review, Solarize SOMA selected Astrum Solar to offer interested homeowners:

- A FREE evaluation to determine if your home location is suitable for a solar installation.

- Attractive financial choices, including a no-money-down monthly lease and a low-interest loan.

- Low group pricing. Prices get even better the more people participate in the program.

Now available: new financing options with no money down!

Don’t miss the deadline! Contact  your solar consultant today to discuss your system and how you can go  solar with Solarize SOMA. You can start producing your own electricity  for less than what you are currently paying your utility company.

Join your neighbors. Switch to solar!
