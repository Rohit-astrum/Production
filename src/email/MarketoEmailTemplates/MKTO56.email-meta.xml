Your Last Chance for Exclusive Savings!

Sign your contract by December 15 to receive low community pricing!

Exclusive savings end on December 15. Act now!

Enrollment for the special group pricing from Astrum Solar has ended. Thank you for your interest in the program! If you are considering switching to solar with Astrum Solar, you have until December 15 to sign your contract and take advantage of the low community pricing provided by the program.

Many of your neighbors are going solar to save thousands on their electric bills in the coming years. Due to Solarize SOMA’s success to date, a new lower pricing level has been reached. You do not want to miss out on these savings; combined with financing options like a no-money-down monthly lease and a low-interest loan, now is the best time to go solar. You can start producing your own electricity for less than what you are currently paying your utility company!

Ready to switch to solar? Here is the next step.
Contact your Solar Consultant today to discuss your system and move forward with signing your contract by December 15. Astrum Solar makes switching to solar easy, turnkey and worry-free. Let us help you start saving today!
