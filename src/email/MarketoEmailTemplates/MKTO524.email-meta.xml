Special Series: Solar Payback Factors

Solar Payback Factor #5: How You Pay for Your Installation

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

Solar has many variables that can influence how much of a return you see from your system. In this special series focusing on solar payback factors, we’ll be taking a look at how you choose to pay for your installation &lt;[[http://pages.directenergysolar.com/rs/astrumsolarinc/images/DirectEnergySolar_UnderstandingSolarPower.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=pbfactors5&amp;utm_campaign=nurture-tk&amp;utm_content=pbfactors5-link-howtopay]]&gt;.

There are many options that exist for financing and terms and conditions vary, so it is important to compare installer estimates of internal rates of return or payback periods to determine what the most cost-effective option is for you:

#1: Leasing Your Solar System:
Leasing lets you go solar for little to no money down, but typically offers you less savings from your system since you do not own it. Since another party puts forward the capital for you, they retain the benefits that come from incentives for system owners.

#2: Financing Your Solar System:
Financing allow you to own the system, but may require larger down payments than a lease offering. If you have some available money to put down, the fact that you will own the incentives can have a significant impact on your return.

#3: Purchasing Your Solar System:
Purchasing the system outright eliminates financing costs and also confers ownership rights to the homeowner. This route provides the highest rates of return if you have the capital to purchase the system.

“People think solar is expensive but they don’t make the right calculation—where else can you put your money into something that gets this kind of return?” - Ted and Luella
