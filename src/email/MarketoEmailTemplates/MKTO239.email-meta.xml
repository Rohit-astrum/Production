Your Neighbors Are Going Solar. You Can Join Them.

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

Join the most popular and quickest-selling community solar program in Massachusetts history!

The program has reached 1 Megawatt in sales with more than 140 homeowners signing up to go solar. Many thanks to the homeowners leading the way! We are two-thirds of the way to Mass Energy&apos;s goal of 200 sales.

For the month of July, we are doubling the referral bonus to $200. This means that if you sign a contract for solar before August 31st and you refer a friend in July who also signs a contract by August 31st, you will receive a check for $200.

Mass Solar Connect is a partnership between Massachusetts Clean Energy Center (MassCEC), Mass Energy Consumers Alliance (Mass Energy) and Direct Energy Solar.


Many thanks to our program leaders!

Our thanks to our Mass Solar Connect program leaders who collectively will install over 1 Megawatt in new clean solar power this year, reducing carbon emissions by 1,000,000 pounds each year. According to the Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator &lt;http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energy-resources/calculator.html&gt; from the EPA, this is equivalent to planting 20,000 leafy green trees.

Hurry, there is not much time left to go solar at Mass Solar Connect&apos;s incredibly low group price!
