Your Sun. Your Power. Your Way.

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

Thank you for your interest in Direct Energy Solar. We are contacting you because you are currently investigating solar for your home and are scheduled to meet with one of our Solar Consultants.

At this time, we have decided to suspend sales in California and will not be taking any new business in your area, effective February 26, 2016.

As a result, your upcoming appointment with us has been cancelled. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

We greatly appreciate your consideration of our company as you begin your solar journey—because when you go solar, we all win by lowering our dependence on foreign and polluting energy sources, creating a cleaner environment for us all.

Please contact us with any questions. Our commitment to providing you with the best customer experience remains our top priority.
