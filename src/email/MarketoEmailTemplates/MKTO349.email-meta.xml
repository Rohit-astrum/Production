Guaranteed Production:

Your system’s energy production is guaranteed for 10 years—this can be extended to 20 years. When your system over performs, you save more. If your system falls short of our production estimates, we’ll pay you a fee to compensate you for that shortfall in production.


Workmanship Warranties:

Your system comes with a 10-Year Workmanship Warranty to guarantee your system is free of defects from materials and components—this warranty can be extended to 20 years. Installation hardware will be serviced free of charge if defects are found.


Manufacturer Warranties:

We use high quality PV panels developed by industry-leading manufacturers who rigorously test their panels and provide 25-year warranties for their products. Panel optimizer warranties vary from 12 years to 25 years, depending on the manufacturer.


A Lifetime of Support:

Rest easy knowing you’ll receive a lifetime of support from a company that has helped thousands of homeowners switch to solar power. We monitor your system and take care of any problems. We’re dedicated to helping you get the most out of your solar home.


Peace of Mind:

Life is full of surprises. We also offer services that extend beyond the installation itself. What if you are moving? What if you need a new roof? We offer solutions to accommodate your needs.
