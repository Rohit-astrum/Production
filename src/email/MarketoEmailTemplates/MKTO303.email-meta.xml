Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

Most homeowners don’t realize how affordable solar has become. According to a report by the International Renewable Energy Agency, prices have fallen by 80% since 2008 and are expected to keep dropping. Meanwhile, panels have become more efficient, offering greater-than-ever savings. What does this have to do with your business? We want your help to get the word out to your customers.

You’re already on their roofs. They are already making a 20+ year investment in their homes. It’s the perfect time for your customers to consider going solar to begin accruing big energy savings every year over the life of their new roof.

Here’s the best part: While you’re helping your customers, you’re also helping your business by earning up to $900 on every qualified customer* you refer &lt;http://partners.directenergysolar.com/roof&gt; to us as a Referral Partner of Direct Energy Solar.

It’s easy and risk-free to sign up to become a partner.
• We will do all the marketing and selling
• You get an easy-to-use online portal to input your leads and to track payouts

Start earning your rewards today!

It’s as simple as that. What a great way to ensure they will continue to do business with you and refer your business to friends and family. I look forward to speaking to you more about this great opportunity for both our businesses.
