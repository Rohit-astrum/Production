Last chance to get full grant savings!

Special community pricing expires October 31. Act now so you don’t miss out!

Take advantage of group pricing before it is gone!

The overwhelming support and enthusiasm for Solarize Andover has made the program an unqualified success, so Astrum Solar is continuing to honor the group pricing through October 31. Act today to get your contract signed before the deadline. Thanks to the hard work of local volunteers, Solarize Andover reached Tier 5 pricing, the lowest available! This means that, in addition to federal and state incentives, everyone who signs up is able to take advantage of the lowest pricing possible through the program. 

Don’t miss the deadline! Now is the best time to go solar. Contact  your solar consultant today to discuss your system and how you  can go  solar. You can start producing your own electricity  for less  than what you are currently paying your utility company.
