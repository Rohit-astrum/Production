Thank You for Choosing Direct Energy Solar and Nest

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

Thank you for choosing Direct Energy Solar for your solar installation. We are honored that you have selected us. Your solar-powered home can be even more energy-efficient with the Nest Learning Thermostat™ you’ll soon receive with our compliments. It will be mailed 30 days from the date you signed your contract*. Thermostats control half of your home’s energy. Teach Nest well and you could save up to 20% on your energy bill.

We truly appreciate your business and hope that you are as excited as we are about your upcoming solar installation.


Nest Support

While Direct Energy Solar cannot install your Nest, Nest Support &lt;http://nest.com/support/thermostat&gt; has a wealth of information.

If you’re comfortable changing a light fixture, you can install Nest. Most people install the Nest Thermostat themselves in 30 minutes or less.

Watch the Nest installation video, quickly solve problems, or get help from a pro. Check out nest.com/support/thermostat &lt;http://nest.com/support/thermostat&gt;.
