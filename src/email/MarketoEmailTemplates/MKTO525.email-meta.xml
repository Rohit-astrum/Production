Special Series: Solar Payback Factors

Solar Payback Factor #2: Your Available Sunlight

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

Solar has many variables that can influence how much of a return you see from your system. In this special series focusing on solar payback factors, we’ll be taking a look at your available sunlight &lt;[[http://pages.directenergysolar.com/rs/astrumsolarinc/images/DirectEnergySolar_UnderstandingSolarPower.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=pbfactors1&amp;utm_campaign=nurture-tk&amp;utm_content=pbfactors2-link-availsun]]&gt;.

One of the most common misconceptions we hear from people is “We don’t get enough sunlight where we live for solar.” The truth is that most homeowners get plenty of sunlight during the year for solar to provide them with an attractive financial return.

How to Determine How Much Sunlight You Receive?

The only sure way to assess how much sunshine you receive is to have Direct Energy Solar’s team of professionals evaluate your home’s potential for solar.

Why does this evaluation matter? It ensures that we can maximize your energy production and financial return by installing as many panels as possible that face south, with a second option for east/west facing panels—these orientations will allow you to capture the maximum amount of sunlight possible.
