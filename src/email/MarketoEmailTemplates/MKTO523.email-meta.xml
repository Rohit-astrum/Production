Special Series: Solar Payback Factors

Solar Payback Factor #4: The Cost of Your Solar Installation

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

Solar has many variables that can influence how much of a return you see from your system. In this special series focusing on solar payback factors, we’ll be taking a look at the total cost of your installation &lt;[[http://pages.directenergysolar.com/rs/astrumsolarinc/images/DirectEnergySolar_UnderstandingSolarPower.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=pbfactors4&amp;utm_campaign=nurture-tk&amp;utm_content=pbfactors4-link-totalcost]]&gt;.

Obviously, the financial return on your solar system is higher the less that you pay for it. The total cost is difficult to standardize as it really depends on individual homeowners. The combination of federal, state, and local incentives, as well as your solar system configuration will determine your out-of-pocket costs for your solar installation:

State and Local Governments Have Credits Available

States and local governments have patchworks of credits that are available to homeowners. We’ll help you determine which discounts are available to you.

What Incentives Are You Entitled To?

When you receive your solar quote from us, it will have a complete breakdown of all available incentives and we’ll help you understand how you receive them.

“It was a no-brainer. With the incentives and rebates, the cost of the system is next to nothing. We couldn’t afford not to do it.” - Mary and David
