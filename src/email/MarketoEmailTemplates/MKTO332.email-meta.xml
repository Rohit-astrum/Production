Earn thousands in added revenue for your business, simply by telling your customers how they can save with solar on their roof.

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

Direct Energy Solar would like to have you on board as a partner. You don’t have to be a solar expert to make this program a success, but it helps to understand the basics. I will help you understand the nuts and bolts about how solar works and what the value of solar is to the homeowner. 

Reach out to your current customer base and let them know you have recently joined Direct Energy Solar as a Referral Partner and can help them go solar with one of the largest and reputable companies in the industry. As a part of the Direct Energy family, you can help them take advantage of our great monthly promotions. What a great way to open up a conversation about solar with an additional offer to motivate your customers.

If you have a physical location that customers visit, ask us how we can help you add signage to ensure customers are aware of the program when they stop by. When you visit customer homes, we can also provide you with materials to leave behind so they can review them. When you refer someone to Direct Energy Solar, you can do so with pride, knowing that we will treat your customers with the same level of care that you would.

What are you waiting for? Get started! &lt;http://partners.directenergysolar.com&gt;
