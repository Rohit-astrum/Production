What If Your Roof Doesn’t Face South?

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

Solar panels need direct sunlight to generate clean electricity. And in the northern hemisphere, this usually means installing south-facing panels that maximize energy capture as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west.

But what happens if you don’t have a south-facing roof? Are you still a good solar candidate?

Hope is not lost! Although southern exposure is ideal, it isn’t always necessary. Let’s explore some of the more popular solutions that homeowners—who don’t have the ideal south-facing roof—are using to maximize their solar potential.
