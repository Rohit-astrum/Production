Your Sun. Your Power. Your Way.

You’re receiving this email because you’ve expressed interest in Mass Solar Connect.

The Mass Solar Connect program is open to Mass Energy members and members of affiliated nonprofits but Direct Energy Solar’s low pricing is only guaranteed for the first 200 people to sign contracts. The enrollment period begins March 2, 2015 and lasts through August 31, 2015. Offers and financing are available to customers who qualify, vary by location, and are not available in all areas. We customize our solar power system specifically for your home, therefore, pricing, savings, utility bill, solar bill amounts and actual returns vary based on different factors including but not limited to your location, system size, available solar incentives and local utility rates. See terms and conditions for more details. Brand names and product names are trademarks or services marks of their respective holders. No obligation of Massachusetts Clean Energy Center (MassCEC), Mass Energy Consumer Alliance (Mass Energy) or any affiliate thereof, should be deemed to arise through the use of such names and marks.
