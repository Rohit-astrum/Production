You’re receiving this email because you’ve expressed interest in Mass Solar Connect.

The Mass Solar Connect program is open to Mass Energy members and members of affiliated nonprofits but Astrum Solar’s low pricing is only guaranteed for the first 200 people to sign contracts. The enrollment period begins March 2, 2015 and lasts through August 31, 2015. A solar power system is customized for your home, so pricing, savings, utility bill and solar bill amounts and actual returns vary based on location, system size, available solar incentives and local utility rates. Financing terms vary by location and are not available in all areas. Brand names and product names are trademarks or services marks of their respective holders. No obligation of Massachusetts Clean Energy Center (MassCEC), Mass Energy Consumer Alliance (Mass Energy) or any affiliate thereof, should be deemed to arise through the use of such names and marks.
