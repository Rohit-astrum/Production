A Special Message for our Valued Customers

IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

We hope you are enjoying the benefits of your new solar system. According to our records your solar system was installed in 2015, and you may be eligible to take advantage of federal government incentives to maximize the return on your investment.

In December of 2015, the federal tax credit was extended through 2019 and purchasers of qualifying solar electric systems may be eligible for a federal tax credit up to 30% of the full cost of installing a system. The credit will remain available after 2019, but it will gradually decrease to 10% in 2022. The credit has no dollar limit to how large it can be, but other restrictions and qualifications may apply.

To take advantage of this tax incentive, simply fill out IRS Form 5695 as part of your federal tax return. This form can be found on the IRS website here &lt;[[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f5695.pdf]]&gt;. If you completed payment for your solar installation in 2015 and have not yet received a paid in full statement from us, please expect to receive your final statement via email from our accounting department by the end of January.

If you have additional questions about your personal tax situation, we recommend that you contact a tax professional. If you have any other inquiries about your system, please do not hesitate to contact the Customer Relationship Team directly, at 1-888-603-6085 or customeradvisors@directenergysolar.com &lt;[[mailto:customeradvisors@directenergysolar.com]]&gt;.

Thank you once more for choosing to go solar with Direct Energy Solar.

Best Regards,
