A Special Message for Our Valued Customers

Get Rewarded for Hosting a Solar Open House!

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

Do you love your system and your savings? Help your friends go green and start saving green with Direct Energy Solar! Invite them to attend a solar open house and make money for doing that!

Direct Energy Solar will have a solar consultant at your party to answer any questions about what’s involved in going solar. Your neighbors will be able to see how your system works and learn more about how the sun can power their homes and reduce their electricity bills.

You&apos;ll Receive $500 from Each Sale From the Open House*

• Direct Energy Solar will cover the cost of the event.
• You may promote the event to your community through channels you see fit.
• Direct Energy Solar can provide marketing materials.

Act now to schedule your event by the end of the year!

Contact: Lindsey Williams, Program Manager, Events &amp; Community Marketing at 443.239.9809 or email lindsey.williams@directenergysolar.com &lt;mailto:lindsey.williams@directenergysolar.com&gt; for more information.

Your Sun. Your Power. Your Way. TM

You are receiving this email because you are a Direct Energy Solar customer.

*You will receive $500 for each referral who signs a contract with Direct Energy Solar, resulting from the open house. There is no limit to the amount of contracts signed from your open house. This offer is not valid within special community pricing programs or in combination with any other offer—if your referral receives special community pricing on their solar contract, you will receive $200. Individuals may not refer themselves. Referrals must have no prior contact with Direct Energy Solar to be considered a customer referral. Payment in the form of a check is sent within 60 days of the sale. If the customer decides to cancel the open house, they will make every effort to provide Direct Energy Solar with at least four weeks notice. The customer agrees that a Direct Energy Solar sales/marketing representative will be onsite to answer questions for visitors.

Offers and financing are not available in all areas. We customize our solar power system specifically for your home, therefore, pricing, savings, utility bill, solar bill amounts and actual returns vary based on different factors including but not limited to your location, system size, available solar incentives and local utility rates. See terms and conditions for more details.
