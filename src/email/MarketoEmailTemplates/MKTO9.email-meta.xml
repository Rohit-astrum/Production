Make Money By Talking to Your Customers About Solar

Solar installations are skyrocketing with more solar installations in the US over the last 18 months than in the past 30 years. With no investment on your part, why not profit from that growth by becoming an Astrum Solar partner?

All you have to do is something you are already doing—talk to your customers in Massachusetts. For every Massachusetts home owner you refer to us that completes a site survey, you get paid, and your cash bonus is even higher if they become one of our customers. You’ll earn $100/Qualified Lead* and $750/Sale!

As a partner with Astrum Solar, you will be working with one of the top ten solar installers in the US who has been recognized as one of the fastest growing companies by Inc. Magazine and has an A rating from the BBB. By helping your customers go solar, you help them save money, increase their home value, become more energy independent and contribute to a cleaner planet. These are benefits all of your customers will appreciate. In addition to these benefits, they’ll receive a $1,000 discount through September 30!**
