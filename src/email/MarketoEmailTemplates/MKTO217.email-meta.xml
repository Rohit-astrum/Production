Your Sun. Your Power. Your Way.

If you&apos;ve been looking into solar, you can&apos;t afford to miss our best offer ever!

{{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

I  wanted to get this quick note off to you to let you know about a  promotion that Direct Energy Solar is offering customers like you who  are considering going solar with us. 

I’m pretty excited because it is, by far, the best package of deals I’ve ever seen since I’ve been with Direct Energy Solar. 

But these deals will only be available in your area until June 15, so you must act today to assure we can lock you into our best pricing ever. Here’s the details of the promotion:

Get $1,500(1) When You Choose to Go Solar With Us!

At Direct Energy Solar, we like to help homeowners save. That’s why we would like to offer you a $1,500 cash back rebate when you sign your contract with us by June 15, 2015. It’s more money to put back into your pocket for better use than electricity bills, and it’s our best cash-back offer yet!

We Guarantee Your Installation or You Get $500!(2)

We want to get you on the road to electricity savings as quickly as possible. If you sign with us by June 15, 2015 and we do not install your solar system within 60 days, you will receive a $500 rebate or deduction from the final invoice.

Contact me today to take advantage of these offers!

Your Sun. Your Power. Your Way.

You’re receiving this email because you’ve expressed interest in a Direct Energy Solar system installation.

(1) Offer valid for qualifying homes that sign a new solar system contract with Direct Energy Solar between May 18, 2015–June 15, 2015. In lieu of a cash rebate, customers can opt to use the $1,500 as a down payment to reduce their monthly solar fees or to receive a $1,500 discount off the contract price at the time of their purchase. Otherwise, $1,500 cash back rebate to be mailed approximately 30 days after the system is installed. Minimum system size is 4 kW. Qualifying homes must be located in a territory that Direct Energy Solar serves. Offer not valid with any other promotions, discounts, or special community pricing programs. Only one discount offer per household.

(2) For systems with signed contracts between May 18, 2015–June 15, 2015, if Direct Energy Solar fails to install your solar system and/or your solar system does not pass electrical inspection within the following timeframes, you will receive $500 (60-day timeframe in CA/MD/NJ; 75-day timeframe in all other regions Direct Energy Solar serves). The number of days due to the following potential delays not caused by Direct Energy Solar will be added to the applicable timeframe: customer scheduling conflicts, structural issues, roof replacements, tree removal, utility transformer issues, and HOA delays. Ground mounts, non-standard roof mounts, commercial systems, leased systems, and systems over 15 kW are excluded. The timeframe begins on the day Direct Energy Solar receives a signed contract and deposit payment (if applicable) for the system. Offer not valid with any other promotions, discounts, or special community pricing programs. Only one discount offer per household.

Offers and financing are not available in all areas. We customize our solar power system specifically for your home, therefore, pricing, savings, utility bill, solar bill amounts and actual returns vary based on different factors including but not limited to your location, system size, available solar incentives and local utility rates. See terms and conditions for more details.
