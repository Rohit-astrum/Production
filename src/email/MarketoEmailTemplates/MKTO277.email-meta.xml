Your Neighbors Are Going Solar. You Can Join Them.

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

Join the most popular and quickest-selling community solar program in Massachusetts history!

Only 2 weeks left to sign a contract to get low Mass Solar Connect pricing. The Mass Solar Connect price is 30% lower than the price paid by MA residents who went solar in 2014.The program ends on August 31st.

160 people have already signed up for solar, making this program one of the  most successful in the history of Solarize Mass programs. 

We are pleased to announce that we are now offering the all-black LG 300-watt panel in place of the Suniva 275-watt panel for the same additional price per watt as the Suniva. This will help increase your power production with fewer panels required to cover your electric bill. If you already have a proposal for Suniva panels from your Solar Consultant, you can choose to continue with these panels or upgrade to the LG. Both panels are warrantied for 25 years and will provide reliable power for years to come.

Many thanks to our program leaders!

Our thanks to our Mass Solar Connect program leaders who collectively will install over 1 Megawatt in new clean solar power this year, reducing carbon emissions by 1,000,000 pounds each year. According to the Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator &lt;http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energy-resources/calculator.html&gt; from the EPA, this is equivalent to planting 20,000 leafy green trees.

Hurry, there is ONLY 2 WEEKS LEFT to go solar at Mass Solar Connect&apos;s incredibly low group price!
