Your Sun. Your Power. Your Way.

We’re Ready to Help You Harness the Sun.

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

You and your home are unique. A cookie-cutter experience for your solar installation won’t provide you with choices so you can decide what’s best for you, your family, and home. Nor will it provide you with the best value. At Direct Energy Solar, our customized process is tailored to each individual—this means we can maximize your energy production and you control how you pay for solar, so you receive greater financial returns and get the most benefits out of your solar home.

See How We Deliver the Best Value in Solar to You:

Step 1: A Quick Phone Call

On this phone call, we’ll evaluate your home’s solar potential using our advanced 3D aerial imagery technology and discuss your current electricity bill. Our consultative approach helps us learn everything we can about your goals and priorities so we can design the system that is best for your home.

Step 2: We Design Your System

If your home is a good candidate for solar, we’ll use the latest technology to measure your sunlight and custom-design a solar system that is tailored specifically for your home. We’ll maximize your solar potential and provide you with a state-of-the-art production estimate that we guarantee.

Step 3: Review Your Proposal

A local Solar Consultant will meet with you in your home to review your custom system design,guaranteed energy production, a choice of payment options, incentives, warranties and more. You’ll have all the facts from our friendly, consultative team to make an informed decision.

Step 4: Installation &amp; Power Up!

Your Project Lead will handle permitting, inspections, interconnection, and more during your project—you don’t have to worry about a thing. All installations are completed within 120 days, guaranteed, and once we receive approval from your utility company, your net meter is installed and you can power up!

Step 5: Lifetime of Support

You can rest easy knowing you’ll receive a lifetime of support from a company that has helped thousands of homeowners switch to solar power. We monitor your system and take care of any problems that arise. We are dedicated to helping you get the most benefits out of your solar home.
