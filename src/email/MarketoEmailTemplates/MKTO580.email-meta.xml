A Message from Our Partner Program

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

As the newly appointed Partner Program Manager at Astrum Solar, I’m here to support you in your efforts to grow your referral network. I’d like to take this opportunity to not only introduce myself but also make you aware of some exciting details.

A New Name. The Same Mission.

I am excited to announce that Astrum Solar is now part of Direct Energy®, one of North America’s largest energy and energy-related services providers with more than seven million residential and commercial customer relationships! As a proud member of the Direct Energy family, Astrum Solar is undergoing a transformation. Our new name, Direct Energy Solar, will be revealed to the public on April 1.

While our website, collateral, and messaging will have a new look and feel, our mission remains the same—to provide an exceptional customer experience and ensure that customers get the most out of their solar panels: the most energy generated, the most electricity savings, the most beneficial environmental impact, and the most joy each time they see a sunny day. In the coming weeks, I will keep you posted on our progress!

The Experience of Serving Over Six Million Homeowners

This is an exciting time to be part of Astrum Solar. The Direct Energy family of companies has served over six million homeowners across North America for over 15 years. Direct Energy has become the largest home services provider on the continent by providing professional, affordable and high-quality energy products and home services to your neighbors. Your customers can trust us with their solar installations and many other home services needs.

I look forward to working with you and sharing my plans to take this program forward.

Thank you,
Suzanne
Sr. Manager, Field Marketing
