A Special Message from Our Partner Program
We miss you, {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}}!

I want to thank you for being a member of our Partner Referral Program. Our referral partners are a critical part of our business growth and I am committed to making this program successful for both of us. Thank you for the leads you have provided in the past – you are helping us to scale our business and we look forward to continuing to compensate you for the referrals that you provide from your customer base.

That said we routinely monitor the performance of our Partners and noticed that we have not seen any leads from you for over 60 days. We understand you are running a successful business and need to make sure you execute your core business well. But want to make sure you know that I am available to assist you if there are specific needs that you may have. If you need a refresher on our partner program or required additional marketing support, I am here! Additionally, your partner portal &lt;http://partners.directenergysolar.com/&gt; has an updated list of marketing collateral available for you to customize. If you need access to the portal please email me at partners@directenergysolar.com &lt;mailto:partners@directenergysolar.com&gt;.

Remember that we routinely have outstanding promotions &lt;http://www.directenergysolar.com/&gt; that you can share with your customers making it easier for them to make the decision to go solar and generating more revenue for you!

Again, I want it as easy as possible for you to make solar available to your customers and generate incremental revenue for your business, so please let me know how I can help you. Thank you for your continued support.
