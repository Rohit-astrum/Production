Thank you for meeting with an Astrum Solar consultant!

Please enjoy your Nest Learning Thermostat™ with our compliments. Your Solar Consultant was happy to share how much money you’ll save on your electricity bill by going solar with Astrum Solar, and how your Nest will save you even more. Your Nest will be mailed 30 days from your in-home consultation. We hope to have the opportunity to help you go solar!

Nest Resources

While Astrum Solar cannot install your Nest, Nest Resources &lt;http://nest.com/support/thermostat&gt; has a wealth of information.

If you’re comfortable changing a light fixture, you can install Nest. Most people install the Nest Thermostat themselves in 30 minutes or less.

Watch the Nest installation video, quickly solve problems, or get help from a pro. Check out nest.com/support/thermostat &lt;http://nest.com/support/thermostat&gt;.
