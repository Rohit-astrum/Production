Sunny Shout-Outs Direct from Our Customers

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

Our customers love us, but we can’t claim all of the credit—let’s face it, the sun does most of the work to power their homes!

We’ve helped thousands of people turn their sunny roofs into electricity savings. And each of our customers had their own reasons for going solar. Our custom-tailored approach helped them meet their specific energy needs and goals.

But now we’ll let Wayne and Vanna do the talking.

Wayne looked into getting solar panels 5 or 10 years ago but found it to be cost-prohibitive. Then, he says, he heard a commercial on the radio that was a turning point in his decision to go solar. It was not only a matter of dollars.

Wayne very much supports the collective effort of using energy efficiently and furthering independence from foreign oil. Ultimately, it’s free money and free energy, he believes.

“If a lot of us did this, what a big difference we could all make.”
