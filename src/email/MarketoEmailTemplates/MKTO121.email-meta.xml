Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

Thank you for requesting your free consultation from Astrum Solar. We are looking forward to discussing your energy needs with you and hope to have the opportunity to help you go solar.

A New Name. The Same Mission.

You may notice something’s different about us. As part of our exciting brand transformation under the Direct Energy family, we’ve changed our name. Let us reintroduce ourselves. We’re Direct Energy Solar!

While our brand has changed and our communications with you have a new look and feel, our mission remains the same—to provide an exceptional customer experience and ensure that our customers get the most out of their solar panels: the most energy generated, the most electricity savings, the most beneficial environmental impact, and the most joy each time they see a sunny day.

The Experience of Serving Over Six Million Homeowners

This is an exciting time for us and our customers. As you may already be aware, Astrum Solar became a proud part of the Direct Energy family in July of 2014. As a member of the Direct Energy family, we can provide a wider array of services and more opportunities for our customers. We will continue our tradition of excellent service, expertise and a worry-free customer experience.

The Direct Energy family of companies has served over six million homeowners across North America for over 15 years. Direct Energy has become the largest home services provider on the continent by providing professional, affordable and high-quality energy products and home services to your neighbors and we would like to do the same for you. You can trust us with your solar installation and many other home services needs.
