Join your neighbors at a Solar Open House!

Solarize Lexington-Bedford ends June 30. Don’t miss out!

The Solarize Lexington-Bedford volunteer team is working hard to spread the word about solar! With 81 homes going solar, the program is very close to meeting its goal of solarizing 100 homes by the program’s June 30 deadline! Join us at the below open houses to see solar panels in action and to get your specific questions answered by Astrum Solar representatives and Solarize volunteers.

Saturday, June 7  |  11:00 AM – 2:00 PM
The home of Marcia and Frank Gens
16 Dane Road, Lexington

Wednesday, June 11  |  6:30 PM – 8:00 PM
The home of Julie Michals and Martin Hodge
35 Saddle Club Road, Lexington
A tour of the system will start at 6:30 PM, followed by a short presentation at 7:00 PM with time for questions.

Solarize Lexington-Bedford is on the home stretch!

There is less than one month left for Solarize Lexington-Bedford! Move quickly to get your contract signed. Thanks to the hard work of local volunteers, Solarize Lexington-Bedford has solarized 81 homes and is very close to reaching its goal of 100! With Tier 5 pricing, the lowest available, everyone who participates in Solarize Lexington-Bedford is able to take advantage of the lowest pricing possible through the program, in addition to state and local incentives. Now is the best time to go solar. But hurry! After June 30, the state rebate will drop and the special pricing available with Solarize Lexington-Bedford will be gone.

Don’t miss the deadline! Contact your solar consultant today to discuss your system and how you can go solar solar with Solarize Lexington-Bedford and start producing your own electricity for less than what you are currently paying your utility company.
