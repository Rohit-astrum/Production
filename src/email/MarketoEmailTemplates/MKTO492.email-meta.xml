How Does the Federal Tax Credit Make Your System Cheaper?

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

The United States government really wants you to go solar. And it wants you to do so affordably.

This is why it is offering a very generous solar incentive that allows you to claim a 30% tax credit after installing your solar system. Why pay full price when the federal government is giving away free money?

But how does the federal solar tax credit work? And why is it important to act now?

“It was a no-brainer. With the incentives and rebates, the cost of the system is next to nothing. We couldn’t afford not to do it.” - Mary and David
