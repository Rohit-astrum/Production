Your Neighbors are Going Solar. You Can Join Them.

Hurry! Online 2 Weeks Left to Sign

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Homeowner}},

If you&apos;re thinking about going solar, the time is now. There are less than two weeks left to go solar through the Solarize Aquidneck program. The program ends on February 15th, and will not be extended! All contracts must be signed by then.  

Don’t miss out on an incredible opportunity many of your Portsmouth neighbors have already jumped on.

If you are already working with a Solar Consultant, then please contact him or her. To request a free site evaluation, access solarizeri.com/solarize-aquidneck &lt;[[http://solarizeri.com/solarize-aquidneck/. ]]&gt;.

Solarize Aquidneck is a community-supported discount buying program for Middletown, Portsmouth and Newport residents that use tiered-pricing, town-supported education and outreach, competitively selected installers and access to flexible financing to dramatically reduce the cost of solar. Thanks to your neighbors who have already gone solar, the program is now in the lowest pricing tier!

Direct Energy Solar was chosen as one of the three installers for this program. While you as the customer, have the option to get a bid with any of the chosen installers, each installer was also assigned to one of the three communities. Direct Energy Solar was assigned to the Portsmouth community!

Thank you.
