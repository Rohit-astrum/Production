Your Sun. Your Power. Your Way.

Our Promise to You

Solar power is a miracle. That’s how it feels.

This life-giving ball of fire rises in the east and sets in the west every day of every year, and with the simple technology of solar panels on your roof, it can power your entire home with free electricity. No fuels. No emissions. Just free electricity.

{{lead.First Name:default=Friend}}, we have dedicated ourselves to making this miracle come true for you...

...in whatever way makes the most sense for you, your home, and your finances. We want to help you make this happen. In fact, we want to make getting solar power from us one of the most deeply satisfying decisions you’ve ever made.

- We treat each of our customers as individuals and provide no cookie-cutter options.

- We design a custom system for your home, because we want your system to generate maximum energy.

- We make the financing easy, so you can choose what’s best for you.

- We provide you with the best guarantees and will be here to support you through the life of your system.

We are backed by the security of Direct Energy.

We are part of the Direct Energy family of brands, one of the largest suppliers of retail energy and home services in North America, which has long been committed to providing alternatives to traditional utility power. With $19.5 billion in 2014 revenue and nearly five million customers, we have the resources to give you peace of mind that we’ll be here to support your solar system for years to come.

We harness our energy expertise to make a difference in people’s lives. We believe in saving you money. We want to put power back in your hands.

You’ll look up at your roof and marvel that this miracle is paying for your electricity.

That the very same thing that is saving you money every single day is also keeping carbon out of the environment. That while saving money, you’ve become part of a movement to take back control, to lead the charge (yes, pun intended), to change the world.

Every so often, you’ll add up how much Direct Energy Solar has saved you, and you’ll be amazed—and proud—you did it. Was going with Direct Energy Solar a windfall? A profitable investment? A successful protection against rising energy prices? The right thing to do? Yes. Yes. Yes. And yes.

And yes, it will be among the most deeply satisfying decisions you’ve ever made.
