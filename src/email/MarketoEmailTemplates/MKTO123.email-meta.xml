A Special Message from Our Partner Program

Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},

Thank you for being a valued partner. We appreciate your business and hope that we are continuing to support you as you grow your referral network. We have some exciting news for you!

We have completed an exciting brand transformation and our new name is Direct Energy Solar.

While our website, collateral, and messaging have a new look and feel, our mission remains the same—to provide an exceptional customer experience and ensure that customers get the most out of their solar panels. Visit the Partner Portal &lt;http://partners.directenergysolar.com&gt; and start using our new collateral today!

Take advantage of Direct Energy Solar’s monthly promotion now through May 31.

Together we can increase our customer communications around going solar and generate even more excitement by taking advantage of limited-time promotions. Customers who meet with a Direct Energy Solar consultant for an in-home consultation by May 31, 2015 will receive a free* 6-month Heating &amp; Cooling Repair Essentials Plan from Direct Energy. This plan provides worry-free coverage for inconvenient repairs. Please note we are not offering this promotion in California or Pennsylvania.

The 6-month plan includes:

• No service visit charge, no deductibles, no age restrictions

• $500 coverage per repair incident up to $2,000 annually

• 24/7 emergency service

In addition, customers receive $500 off their solar system when they sign by May 31, 2015.** This promotion is valid in all territories we serve.

If you have any questions regarding the promotion, please let me know. The weather is breaking (on the East Coast) so let’s start talking solar. More conversations with your customer mean more money in your pocket.

Thank you for your continued support.

Meet with a Direct Energy Solar consultant for an in-home consultation between April 1, 2015–May 31, 2015 and receive a free 6-month trial of our Heating &amp; Cooling Repair Essentials Plan.

*No extensions will be granted. An in-home consultation is contingent on your home being a good candidate for solar and your home being located in a territory where Direct Energy Solar completes in-home consultations. The Direct Energy Heating &amp; Cooling Repair Essentials Plan (the “Plan”) is provided by Home Warranty of America, Inc., a Direct Energy company. Not available in all states. There is a 30-day waiting period before coverage begins (giving you 5 months of coverage). The Plan is only free for the initial term of 6 months. Terms and conditions apply. Supplies are limited. Only one offer per household.

**$500 cash back offer valid for qualifying homes that sign a new solar system contract with Direct Energy Solar between April 1, 2015–May 31, 2015. In lieu of a cash rebate, customers can opt to use the $500 as a down payment to reduce their monthly solar fees or to receive a $500 discount off the contract price at the time of their purchase. Otherwise, $500 cash back rebate to be mailed approximately 30 days after the system is installed. Minimum system size is 5 kW. Qualifying homes must be located in a territory that Direct Energy Solar serves. Offer not valid with any other promotions, discounts, or special community pricing programs. Only one discount offer per household.

Offers and financing are not available in all areas. We customize our solar power system specifically for your home, therefore, pricing, savings, utility bill, solar bill amounts and actual returns vary based on different factors including but not limited to your location, system size, available solar incentives and local utility rates. See terms and conditions for more details.
