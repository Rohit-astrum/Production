Dear {{lead.First Name:default=Friend}},
Adoption of solar power is skyrocketing! As costs for solar continue to plummet, solar has become affordable for millions of homeowners. What’s driving this rush to solar? It’s the potential to dramatically decrease the high cost of electricity.
As you know adding a pool increases a homeowner’s cost of electricity by 30-50%. But now you can help your customers erase these escalating energy costs just by letting them know about the benefits of going solar.
Here’s the best part: While you’re helping your customers, you’re also helping your business by earning up to $900 on every qualified customer you refer to us as a Referral Partner &lt;http://partners.directenergysolar.com/dive-into&gt; of Direct Energy Solar.
We can help them cut their energy costs immediately, often with no money down. It’s as simple as that. What a great way to ensure they will continue to do business with you and refer your business to friends and family.









Program Benefits:

• Help customers offset the cost of pool ownership

• Easy to become a referral partner

• Risk-free for your business

• Customizable marketing materials to help you talk about solar

• Simple online portal to input leads and track your revenue
