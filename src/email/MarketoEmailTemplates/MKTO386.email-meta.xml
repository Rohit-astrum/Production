Dear Homeowner,

Congratulations on your smart decision to protect your home with a warranty from Home Warranty of America. You have a hardworking, trustworthy, helpful and friendly company by your side. When your home systems need repair, there’s no question who you will turn to or how you’ll pay for it. That’s great peace of mind.

Did you know you are connected to a family of brands?

Your warranty connects you to a family of brands owned by Direct Energy, which has become one of the largest retail providers of electricity, natural gas, and home services in North America by providing professional, affordable and high-quality energy products and home services to millions of homeowners. That’s even greater peace of mind.

Introducing our newest family member, Direct Energy Solar.

Did you know that great way to take control of your energy costs is to use the power of the sun? Solar energy has the potential to save you thousands on your energy bills for decades, and Direct Energy’s newest division, Direct Energy Solar, can show you how.

Why are so many Americans switching to solar energy?

We’ve all been there. Month after month, we open the utility bill...only to be shocked at its unpredictability. Going solar can insulate you from electricity rate increases, and its positive impact on daily life is profound. When your home is solar powered, you can worry less about the small stuff, like recharging your family’s gadgets or turning up the thermostat a few degrees on a chilly night. And you can feel great about the big stuff, like your lighter carbon footprint and the example you are setting for your friends, neighbors and family.
